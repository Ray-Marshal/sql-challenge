# sql-challenge
In this project, I am tasked by my employer Pewlett Hackard to create SQL tables using old employee CSV files so they can be queried. In the repository you'll find the original CSV files, a PNG image of the ERD I created using app.quickdatabasediagrams.com, and two SQL files; One file creates the table schemas and the other includes the queries used to get the information asked of us.

The majority of the information comes from the Employees table, though I often used Dept_Emp and Dept_Manager as junction tables to pull in information about Departments and Management.
